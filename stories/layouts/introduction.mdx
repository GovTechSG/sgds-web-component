# App Layout Templates

 Layout templates for common application patterns, helping you structure your pages with consistent spacing, navigation, and content containers.

## Prerequisites

Before using the app layout templates, ensure that you have set up the **utility CSS** in your project. This is required for all styling and spacing utilities used in the templates.

See the [Utilities documentation](/docs/utilities-introduction--docs) for setup instructions.
