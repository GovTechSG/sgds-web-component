# SGDS Utility

SGDS utility provides CSS class utilities powered by Tailwind generator. It offers a convenient way to apply design tokens and styling directly through utility classes in your HTML.

## What is SGDS Utility?

SGDS utility classes are:

- **CSS class utility tokens** powered by the Tailwind CSS generator
- **Prefixed with `sgds:`** to ensure specificity and prevent CSS naming conflicts
- **Stripped of Tailwind's default stylings** and fully powered by SGDS CSS variable tokens, ensuring consistent design system adherence

This approach allows you to leverage utility-first CSS with SGDS design tokens while maintaining design consistency across your application.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install the package:**

   ```bash
   npm install @govtechsg/sgds-web-component
   ```

2. **Configure Tailwind CSS:**

   Follow the [Tailwind CSS installation guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/framework-guides) for your framework.

3. **Import SGDS CSS files:**

   ```javascript
   // Import theme files
   import '@govtechsg/sgds-web-component/themes/day.css';
   import '@govtechsg/sgds-web-component/themes/night.css';
   
   // Import utility styles
   import '@govtechsg/sgds-web-component/css/utility.css';
   ```

## Using SGDS Utility Tokens

Once installed and configured, you can start using SGDS utility classes in your application:

```html
<!-- Example: Using SGDS utility classes -->
 <div class="sgds:bg-surface-raised sgds:p-lg sgds:mb-md">
      <h3 class="sgds:text-default sgds:mb-sm">Card with Default Text</h3>
      <p class="sgds:text-subtle sgds:mb-sm">This is subtle text for secondary information like descriptions or metadata.</p>
      <p class="sgds:text-muted">This is muted text for tertiary content or less important details.</p>
    </div>
```

All utility classes follow the `sgds:` prefix convention and are fully supported by SGDS CSS variables, ensuring a seamless design system experience.
