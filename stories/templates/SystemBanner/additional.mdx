## Dismissible

The dismissible prop adds a close button to the system banner to allow the component to be removed from the DOM when no longer needed.
When the close button is clicked, it updates the `show` state of the system banner to false.

<Canvas of={SystemBannerStories.Dismissible}>
  <Story of={SystemBannerStories.Dismissible} />
</Canvas>

## Two-line clamped and show more

The two-line clamped feature limits the content of the system banner to two lines to achieve a consistency in the banner's height. It is a responsive feature that ensures the banner looks good on all screen sizes.
If the content exceeds two lines, it will be truncated with an ellipsis and a show more link appears.

When the show more link is clicked, it emits a custom event called `sgds-show-more`
You can hook onto the click event of the show more link to perform your side effect action. It could be an opening of a modal
or a redirect to another page.

In this example, the show more link opens a modal with the full message about the banner content.

<Canvas of={SystemBannerStories.ShowMore}>
  <Story of={SystemBannerStories.ShowMore} />
</Canvas>

## No Clamp Action

The `noClampAction` prop disables the "show more" link functionality when set to `true`. When enabled, long content will be truncated with an ellipsis only, without providing the option to expand the message.

This is useful when you want to enforce a strict two-line limit for banner messages without giving users the ability to view the full content. All child `sgds-system-banner-item` components will inherit this behavior.

**Key behaviors when `noClampAction` is true:**
- Text content is truncated to two lines with an ellipsis
- No "show more" link appears, even for long content
- The `sgds-show-more` event will not be emitted

<Canvas of={SystemBannerStories.NoClampAction}>
  <Story of={SystemBannerStories.NoClampAction} />
</Canvas>
