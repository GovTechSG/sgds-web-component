## Dismissible

The dismissible prop adds a close button to the system banner to allow the component to be removed from the DOM when no longer needed.
When the close button is clicked, it updates the `show` state of the system banner to false.

## Action slot

The action slot allows you to add a custom action element to the system banner. This can be a link or a button.

## Two-line clamped

The two-line clamped feature limits the content of the system banner to two lines to achieve a consistency in the banner's height.
If the content exceeds two lines, it will be truncated with an ellipsis and a show more link appears.

When the show more link is clicked, it emits a custom event called `sgds-show-more`
You can hook onto the click event of the show more link to perform your side effect action. It could be an opening of a modal
or a redirect to another page.
