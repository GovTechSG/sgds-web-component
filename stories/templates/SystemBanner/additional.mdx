## Variants

The default variant is `info`. Modify the `variant` prop to the intended value.

- Use `info` banner to provide additional information to users that is related to their completion of current action or task. Info variant is using primary brand color.
- Use `danger` banner to alert users of a critical error or failure. Users may be prevented to proceed unitl the issue is rectified.
- Use `warning` banner to alert users that are engaging in less desirable actions that may have unexpected results.
- Use `neutral` banner to provide additional information to users that is not related to their completion of current action or task

## Dismissible

The dismissible prop adds a close button to the system banner to allow the component to be removed from the DOM when no longer needed.
When the close button is clicked, it updates the `show` state of the system banner to false.

## Two-line clamped and show more

The two-line clamped feature limits the content of the system banner to two lines to achieve a consistency in the banner's height. It is a responsive feature that ensures the banner looks good on all screen sizes.
If the content exceeds two lines, it will be truncated with an ellipsis and a show more link appears.

When the show more link is clicked, it emits a custom event called `sgds-show-more`
You can hook onto the click event of the show more link to perform your side effect action. It could be an opening of a modal
or a redirect to another page.

In this example, the show more link opens a modal with the full message about the banner content.
