## Pagination with API sample

The `<sgds-pagination>` component will include some props which is needed for the pagination to work. Users will be required to provide the data objects to be passed in as data length `dataLength`,
a current page `currentPage` set as initial active, and set the number of data items to be rendered per page `itemsPerPage`. Listen to `sgds-page-change` event for page changes and populate back the logic to `sgds-table` component. Below is a sample of pagination with a table formatted data.

## Alternative Sizes

By default, the size is set at `sm`. Alternatively, you could also specify `md` or `lg` to alter the sizes.

## Direction Variant

The `directionVariant` string prop allows you to toggle between rendering text and arrow direction for the increment/decrement pages button as shown below. By default, it is set to `icon-text`, but can be also be set to just `text` or `icon`.

## Setting Limit

The `limit` prop will set the number of pages shown at any one time. It will be based on the `data.length` and `itemsPerPage` provided by user. By default, `limit` is set to **3** and `itemsperPage` is set to **5**.

To illustrate, the examples below has been set to use a dummy data `data.length` of **10** and `itemsPerPage` of **1**. So altogether, there will be a total of **10** pages in the pagination. By setting the limit to **3** or **5** or **8**, it will show the number of pages equal to the particular limit given. Do note that if `limit` is set to be of higher value than the total pages for the pagination, it will just render the total pages at one go, ignoring the `limit`.

## Ellipsis Mode

The `ellipsisOn` boolean prop allows user to skip pages using `ellipsisJump`. By default with false, it shows a disabled increment ellipsis button. Setting to true will render and allow functionality of both ellipsis direction button.

## Ellipsis Jump

By default, `ellipsisJump` value is set to **3**. Set as desired to decrement/increment pages for the Ellipsis button. The `ellipsisJump` are set to be of limit **3**, **6**,**12** respectively. If the `ellipsisJump` is set to be of higher value than the total pages(`dataLength / itemsPerPage`) in pagination, it will decrement/increment to the end of the pages respectively.
