## Pagination with API sample

The `<sgds-pagination>` component will include some props which is needed for the pagination to work. Users will be required to provide the data objects to be passed in as data length `dataLength`,
a current page `currentPage` set as initial active, and set the number of data items to be rendered per page `itemsPerPage`. Listen to `sgds-page-change` event for page changes and populate back the logic to `sgds-table` component. Below is a sample of pagination with a table formatted data.
