## Responsive

Responsive tables allow tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease.

## Always Responsive

Across every breakpoint, use `responsive="always"` for horizontally scrolling tables. Responsive tables are wrapped automatically in a `div`. The following example has 12 columns that are scrollable horizontally.

<Canvas of={TableStories.AlwaysResponsive}>
  <Story of={TableStories.AlwaysResponsive} />
</Canvas>

## Breakpoint Specific

Use `responsive="sm"`, `responsive="md"` , `responsive="lg"`, or `responsive="xl"` as needed to create responsive tables up to a particular breakpoint. From that breakpoint and up, the table will behave normally and not scroll horizontally.

<Canvas of={TableStories.Responsive}>
  <Story of={TableStories.Responsive} />
</Canvas>

## Structured Elements

Use `sgds-table-row`, `sgds-table-cell`, `sgds-table-head` to build the whole table using structured elements

<Canvas of={TableStories.StructuredElements}>
  <Story of={TableStories.StructuredElements} />
</Canvas>
