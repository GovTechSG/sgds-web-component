## Responsive

Responsive tables allow tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease.

## Always Responsive

Across every breakpoint, use `responsive="always"` for horizontally scrolling tables. Responsive tables are wrapped automatically in a `div`. The following example has 12 columns that are scrollable horizontally.

<Canvas of={TableStories.AlwaysResponsive}>
  <Story of={TableStories.AlwaysResponsive} />
</Canvas>

## Breakpoint Specific

Use `responsive="sm"`, `responsive="md"` , `responsive="lg"`, or `responsive="xl"` as needed to create responsive tables up to a particular breakpoint. From that breakpoint and up, the table will behave normally and not scroll horizontally.

<Canvas of={TableStories.Responsive}>
  <Story of={TableStories.Responsive} />
</Canvas>

## Dynamic Cell Content

Use `ICellItem` in your TableData in order to render different item in the table.
Refer to [button](?path=/docs/components-button--docs), [link](?path=/docs/components-link--docs), [badge](?path=/docs/components-badge--docs) and [icon-button](?path=/docs/components-iconbutton--docs) for more information on each property.

```
export type ICellItem = {
  id: string;
  type: "button" | "link" | "badge" | "icon-button";
  value: string;
  fullWidth?: boolean;
  variant?: string;
  size?: string;
  active?: boolean;
  disabled?: boolean;
  href?: string;
  target?: string;
  download?: string;
  ariaLabel?: string;
  outlined?: boolean;
};
```

  <Story of={TableStories.DynamicCellData} />
</Canvas>
