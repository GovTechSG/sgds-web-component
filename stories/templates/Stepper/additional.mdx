## Pass IStepsMetadata to steps prop 

`steps` prop is an array of object defined by interface `IStepMetaData`

```tsx
export interface IStepMetaData {
  component: unknown;
  stepHeader: string;
}
```

- `component` refers to the component to render for each step. The type of component set to unknown as it depends on which frontend library you are using. 
For example, it could be a vue component / react component / angular component depending on your frontend library of choice
- `stepHeader` refers to the header title per step.
- The step number is defined by the object's index of the array

## Vertical stepper

By default, stepper is of `horizontal` orientation. Set stepper to vertical with `orientation="vertical"`

<Canvas of={StepperStories.Orientation}>
  <Story of={StepperStories.Orientation} />
</Canvas>

## Clickable steps

## Stepper in a form context

The example below is build with Lit library. As each frontend library has their own lifecycle hooks and unique syntax for props and event handling, 
you will need to manage the rendering of components on your end. Here is a general guide to building a form stepper like the one below. 
Reference the API table and methods table carefully when creating the Stepper component.

1. Build your child components. The stepper example has three steps and each step has its own component.
  These three components will be the direct child of your StepperComponent

  Step 1: Personal Details 
  Step 2: Address and Contact details 
  Step 3: Review  

2. Create the parent component. This is where all the state of `steps` and `activeStep` will be managed and should persist. 
  This component should capture and store any user input. This component should handle the dynamic rendering of child components depending on the current `activeStep`.
  Use SgdsStepper's  `getComponent` public method to obtain current component.
  Make use of the SgdsStepper's public methods to create button actions for next/previous/last/first step or reset.

  <Story of={StepperStories.StepperExample} />
</Canvas>
