## Variants

The default variant is `primary`. Modify the `variant` prop to the intended value.

- Use `primary` buttons to show the key action on a page or view. Most pages should only have one primary action.
- Use `outline` buttons next to primary buttons to indicate alternative or less pronounced actions.
- Use `ghost` button for supplementary action as they are subtle in their appearance 
- Use `danger` buttons  to remove things or for irreversible actions.

## Full Width

Buttons can fill any container width. This is common on mobile devices where there's a shorter overall viewport or where buttons are stacked to make buttons visually consistent.

## Sizes

The default button size is medium. Add `size="lg"`,` size="sm"` for additional sizes.

- Large buttons are used sparingly across the UI. They may be used for page components that demand attention, such as on the homepage banner.
- The medium (default) button is the standard size for buttons everywhere.
- Small button should be used sparingly and only in places where the UI is very dense.

## Hover / Active state

To set a button's active state, set the component's `active` prop.

<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Active}>
  <Story of={ButtonStories.Active} />
</Canvas>

## Disabled state

The disabled state indicates that an action canâ€™t be taken until a previous action is completed.
Add `disabled` prop to the button to apply the disabled state

  <Story of={ButtonStories.Disabled} />

## With Icon

Leading icons can visually represent a button's action to lessen the cognitive load for users. Use `slot="rightIcon"` to add a leading icon to the button 
Trailing icons should be used in specific use cases as a nod to the interaction. Use `slot="leftIcon"` to add a trailing icon to the button
