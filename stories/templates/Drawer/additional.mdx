## Placement

The drawer supports multiple placement options to control where the drawer appears on the screen.

By default, the drawer opens from the right (end). You can specify different placements using the placement attribute:

- `placement="start"`: Opens from the left
- `placement="end"`: Opens from the right
- `placement="top"`: Slides in from the top
- `placement="bottom"`: Slides in from the bottom
