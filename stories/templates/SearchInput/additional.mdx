  <Story of={SearchInputStories.Loading} />
</Canvas>

### Usage behaviour of SearchInput 

The use case of a search input is to provide users with a way to search and select from a large or remote dataset. 
Typically, the component starts with no menu options available. As the user types, the application fetches matching options from an API 
and populates the menu dynamically. This pattern is ideal for autocomplete or search-as-you-type scenarios, where options are not known in advance and must be loaded based on user input.

1. The initial state has no options in the dropdown.

<Canvas of={SearchInputStories.Empty}>
  <Story of={SearchInputStories.Empty} />
</Canvas>

2. The user types and loading state is shown while fetching options.

Once results are fetched, they are added as menu options for the user to select.

<Canvas of={SearchInputStories.UserTypesAndLoads}>
  <Story of={SearchInputStories.UserTypesAndLoads} />
</Canvas>

3. Search Input menu is populated with loaded data

<Canvas of={SearchInputStories.DataLoaded}>
  <Story of={SearchInputStories.DataLoaded} />
</Canvas>
