## Variants

The default variant is `primary`. Modify the `variant` prop to the intended value.

- Use `primary` buttons to show the key action on a page or view. Most pages should only have one primary action.
- Use `outlined` buttons next to primary buttons to indicate alternative or less pronounced actions.
- Use `ghost` button for supplementary action as they are subtle in their appearance 
- Use `danger` buttons  to remove things or for irreversible actions.

## Sizes

The default button size is medium. Add `size="lg"`,` size="sm"` for additional sizes.

- Large buttons are used sparingly across the UI. They may be used for page components that demand attention, such as on the homepage banner.
- The medium (default) button is the standard size for buttons everywhere.
- Small button should be used sparingly and only in places where the UI is very dense.

## Hover / Active state

To set a button's active state, set the component's `active` prop.

<Canvas of={IconButtonStories.Active}>
  <Story of={IconButtonStories.Active} />
</Canvas>

## Disabled state

The disabled state indicates that an action canâ€™t be taken until a previous action is completed.
Add `disabled` prop to the button to apply the disabled state

<Canvas of={IconButtonStories.Disabled}>
  <Story of={IconButtonStories.Disabled} />
</Canvas>
