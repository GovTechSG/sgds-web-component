## Variants

The default variant is `primary`. Modify the `variant` prop to the intended value.

- Use `primary` buttons to show the key action on a page or view. Most pages should only have one primary action.
- Use `outlined` buttons next to primary buttons to indicate alternative or less pronounced actions.
- Use `ghost` button for supplementary action as they are subtle in their appearance
- Use `danger` buttons to remove things or for irreversible actions.

## Tone

Tone sets the colour of the button. Use the `tone` prop to modify the button's appearance.

- Use `brand` tone for main action in the interface. Using the brand color draws attention.
- Use `danger` tone for destructive or irreversible action
- Use `fixed-light` tone for high-contrast white button for dark or image backgrounds.
- Use `neutral` tone for buttons for high-contrast black/gray button on light backgrounds.

## Sizes

The default button size is medium. Add `size="lg"`,` size="sm"`, `size="xs"` for additional sizes.

- Large buttons are used sparingly across the UI. They may be used for page components that demand attention, such as on the homepage banner.
- The medium (default) button is the standard size for buttons everywhere.
- Small button should be used sparingly and only in places where the UI is very dense.

## Disabled state

The disabled state indicates that an action canâ€™t be taken until a previous action is completed.
Add `disabled` prop to the button to apply the disabled state
