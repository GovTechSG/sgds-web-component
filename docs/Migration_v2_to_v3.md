# Migration Guide

## From version 2.x.x to 3.x.x

### Changes

In version 3, we revamped the component designs and moved away from Bootstrap designs completely, added new features and dropped some in our components.
We also setup our own naming convention for css variable tokens which is used both in our Figma and source code. Our new tokens system, enabled us to provide `night` theme in all our components in v3.

We also introduced foundational styles to allow users who want to wholistically style their app with SGDS.
