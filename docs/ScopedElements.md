# Scoped Elements

As a global registry, the [CustomElementRegistry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomElementRegistry) cannot have multiple version of the same custom element. This is the limitation of the CustomElementRegistry. [Scoped Custom Element Registries](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/716) is a proposal that will solve the problem. Since this functionality won't be available (especially not cross browser) anytime soon, we've adopted [OpenWC's Scoped Elements](https://open-wc.org/docs/development/scoped-elements/).

Whenever a sgds web component uses composition (meaning it uses another sgds component inside), we
apply ScopedElementsMixin to make sure it uses the right version of this internal component.

```jsx
export class SgdsDropdown extends ScopedElementsMixin(DropdownListElement) {
  static get scopedElements() {
    return {
      "sgds-button": SgdsButton
    };
  }

  render() {
    return html`
      <div>
        <sgds-button>
          ${this.togglerText}
        </sgds-button>
        <ul class="dropdown-menu" role="menu" part="menu">
          <slot id="default" @click=${this.handleSelectSlot}></slot>
        </ul>
      </div>
    `;
  }

```

## Scoped Custom Element Registry Polyfill 

### When to load the polyfill

Loading the polyfill is only required for components that uses the ScopeElementsMixin as shown in the code snippet above.
As a rule of thumb, start by not loading the polyfill. If you encounter an error like so, it means you need to load the polyfill.


>`Uncaught DOMException: Failed to execute 'define' on 'CustomElementRegistry': the name "sgds-<component-name>" has already been used with this registry at`


> Not loading the polyfill by default will also allow sites to opt out of it altogether. This means until the browser ships scoped registries, the developer can choose to fall back to the global registry, by not loading the polyfill. This will save bandwidth & complexity since it doesn't need to be loaded by the client in that case. [Source](https://open-wc.org/blog/scoped-elements-without-polyfill/)

### How to load the polyfill 

#### Local installation

```js

npm install @webcomponents/scoped-custom-element-registry@0.0.9

```

```js

// Polyfill has to be loaded at the top of the application before the web components
import "@webcomponents/scoped-custom-element-registry"
import "@govtechsg/sgds-web-component";

```

#### CDN usage

Load the polyfill CDN before the web component CDN 

```js

// load scoped custom element registry polyfill first
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@webcomponents/scoped-custom-element-registry@0.0.9"></script>

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@govtechsg/sgds-web-component@<version>"></script>

```
