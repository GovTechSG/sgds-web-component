# Lit Sass Typescript Starter

This is a project that has a very simple setup for SASS + TS + Lit that uses rollup.

See an online demo [here on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/lit-sass-ts-starter).

## Goals

* Get started with Lit + SASS + TS
  * For JS see [`e111077/lit-sass-js-starter`](https://github.com/e111077/lit-sass-js-starter)
* Exemplify how to setup rollup to support this config

## Non-goals

* This does not include a production build as that may vary from project to project
* This does not support Lit 1
  * It can, but the imports will have to be changed
* This does not recommend an Lit app structure - only exemplifies the build setup

## Get Started

Clone the repo. Then install.

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the dev server and rollup watchers

```bash
npm run dev
```

A browser window should open and rollup will watch your files for changes.
