## Sorting

Sorting on a column is enabled by adding the `sort` property. The sorting algorithm is based on javascript array.sort() method. In ascending order from bottom, alphabets come first, followed by numbers, and then symbols. Similarly, in descending order from bottom, symbols come first, followed by numbers, and then alphabets.

<Canvas>
  <Story
    name="Sorting"
    args={{
      sort: "true"
    }}
  >
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Removable Sort

When `removableSort` is present, the third click removes the sorting from the column.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="removableSort" args={{ removableSort: true }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Striped Body

Adds zebra-striping using striped to table row within the `<tbody>`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="striped" args={{ striped: true }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Bordered Body

Use `bordered` to add borders on all sides of the table and cells.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="bordered" args={{ bordered: true }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Borderless Body

Add `borderless` to remove all borders on the table and cells, including table header.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="borderless" args={{ borderless: true }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Hovered Body

Use hover to enable a hover state on table rows within a `<tbody>`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="hover" args={{ hover: true }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Dark Table

Use `variant="dark"` to invert the colors of the table and get light text on a dark background.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="variant" args={{ variant: "dark" }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Responsive

Responsive tables allow tables to be scrolled horizontally with ease.

## Always Responsive

Across every breakpoint, use `responsive="always"` for horizontally scrolling tables. Responsive tables are wrapped automatically in a `div`. The following example has 12 columns that are scrollable horizontally.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="alwaysResponsive" args={{ responsive: "always" }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Breakpoint Specific

Use `responsive="sm"`, `responsive="md"` , `responsive="lg"`, or `responsive="xl"` as needed to create responsive tables up to a particular breakpoint. From that breakpoint and up, the table will behave normally and not scroll horizontally.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="responsive" args={{ responsive: "sm" }}>
    {Template.bind({})}
  </Story>
</Canvas>
